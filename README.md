## My responsive portfolio

## This project showcases my bootstrap and css approach on a single application. 
<https://rodolfod1.github.io/MyResponsive-Portfolio/>

* A simple and minimalistic approach to my portfolio.

    - Bold and approach since my artistic skills are just being develop. 
    - As I grow up on my full stack carreer, will improve this portfolio adding fresher and appealing features.
    - Basic features are showcased by now with full concept understanding.

## This project Content:
    * HTML files: 
    -  Index.html --> contains the portfolio cover page and my Bio highlights. 
        - A Navigation bar can be found consistently thru the entire project, so it facilitates the switch among the pages 
        - Live Links to my social sites and repositories can be fond on a sticky footer. 
    - Portfolio.html --> A snapshot thru the kind of work i do using cards and grid layout. 
    - Contact.html --> Contact form with the action to e-mail me .

    * CSS:
    - Style.css --> a few customizations to the bootstrap and other items.
    
    *Asset Folder:
     - It has all the images i used for this project.
